# GeekOut
GeekOut is a platform to connect with fellow geeks/nerds/cool people. 

## How does it work
1. Create an account using your email
2. Create an event (board games session, DnD campaing). Set a date, location and number of players.
3. Rejoice as other users sign up for your event.
4. Go and have a good time!

## Site functionalities

- Login / Sign up. Includes a link to the password recovery page

  - Calendar showing events for the month
  - List of events the user has signed for

  - Navbar menu with link to the profile/settings page and logout button
- Profile / Settings

  - Users can set their profile information (optional).
- User profile (as seen by other users)
  - Shows that user's profile information (if any). Otherwise it shows a default user icon as image and the message: "This user is quite misterious"
- Password recovery. Allows the user to input the email and get a password recovery email. After submission it redirects the user to the login page.
